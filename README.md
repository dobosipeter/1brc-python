# 1brc-python  
  
This repository will contain my attempt at solving the [1brc](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) using Python.  
My initial approach will be simple and likely inefficient, I expect to learn more efficient methods of achieving the same thing as I go.
  
## Task  
The task is to write a Python program which:
1. reads the file
2. calculates the following temperature values per weather station:
    1. min
    2. mean
    3. max
3. emits the results on stdout like this:  
_(i.e. sorted alphabetically by station name, and the result values per station in the format <min>/<mean>/<max>, rounded to one fractional digit)_  
    > {Abha=-23.0/18.0/59.2, Abidjan=-16.2/26.0/67.3, Abéché=-10.0/29.4/69.0, Accra=-10.1/26.4/66.4, Addis Ababa=-23.7/16.0/67.0, Adelaide=-27.8/17.3/58.5, ...}

The challenge aims to solve the problem in the shortest time possible. My hardware is limited compared to the one described in the solution, I will have to get creative.
